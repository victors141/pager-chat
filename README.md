## Things to improve
- Implement tests
- Add emojis
- Include husky to check eslint and test before commit.
- Improve the server-app to save the messages using a database.
- Giphy API key should be in the server to avoid storing in the frontend app.
- Implement a carousel to have more gif options.
- Panel to show the current users connected(the info is in the app but the design doesn't have this).
- Use a logger to check possible bugs.
- Offline support
